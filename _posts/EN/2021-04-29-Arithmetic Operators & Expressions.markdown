Without **arithmetic operators** and **expressions**, we would be have no ability to manipulate or change variables.  In the previous post, we saw a simple example of the addition operator (+).  There are 5 arithmetic operators.

* \+ (the addition operator, adds the numbers on either side of the operator)
* \- (the subtraction operator)
* \* (the multiplication operator)
* \ (the division operator)
* % (the remainder division operator)
