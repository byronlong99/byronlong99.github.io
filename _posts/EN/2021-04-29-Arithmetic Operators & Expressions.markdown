Without **arithmetic operators** and **expressions**, we would be have no ability to manipulate or change **variables**.  In the previous post, we saw a simple example of the addition operator (+).  

There are 5 basic operators available in **C#**:

* \+ (the **addition** operator. i.e. 5 + 3, adds 3 to 5. result: 8 )
* \- (the **subtraction** operator. i.e. 5 - 3.  subtracts 3 from 5.  result: 2)
* \* (the **multiplication** operator. i.e. 5 * 3. multiplies 5 by 3. result: **15**)
* \ (the **division** operator. i.e. 5 / 3. divides 5 by 3. result: **1**)
* % (the **remainder division** operator. i.e. divies 5 by 3 and takes the remainder. result: **2**)
