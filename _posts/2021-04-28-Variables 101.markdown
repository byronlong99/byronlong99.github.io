Variables are how we maintain state in a program.  Without them, we would be limited to hard-coded values.  

```csharp
using System;
 
namespace ConsoleApp
{
    static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

```console
C:\Users\MyAccount\ConsoleApp\ConsoleApp\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1>ConsoleApp.exe
Hello World!
```

The **console** represents the the command window above and we can either write text to it (in the form of a string, more on this later) or read text from it (also in the form of a string).
