Variables are how we maintain state in a program.  Without them, we would be limited to hard-coded values.  There are many types of variables we can create.  Below is a list of examples:

* **bool** (either "true" or "false")
* **int** (32-bit integer.  Values range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
* **long** (64-bit integer)
* **float** (32-bit floating point number)
* **double**
* **decimal** ()
* **string**

These types are called primitives, since they are the simplest types that can be declared.  More complex programs typically will require more complex types but that will be covered in a future blog.


```csharp
using System;
 
namespace ConsoleApp
{
    static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            
        }
    }
}
```

```console
C:\Users\MyAccount\ConsoleApp\ConsoleApp\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1>ConsoleApp.exe
Hello World!
```

The **console** represents the the command window above and we can either write text to it (in the form of a string, more on this later) or read text from it (also in the form of a string).
