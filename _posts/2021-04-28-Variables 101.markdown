**Variables** are how we maintain state in a program.  Without them, we would be limited to hard-coded values and programs would not be able to change their output in response to user input.  There are many types of variables we can create.  Below is a list of examples:

* **bool** (either "true" or "false")
* **int** (32-bit integer.  Values range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
* **long** (64-bit integer)
* **float** (32-bit floating point number)
* **double** (64-bit floating point number)
* **char** (single character.  i.e. c, 9, r, V)
* **string** (text.  i.e. "Billy Bob")

These types are called primitives since they are the simplest types that can be declared.  More complex programs typically will require more complex types but that will be covered in a future post.  Let's use a simple example of **integers**.  

#### Problem 
The local animal shelter calls you.  They say that they've taken in too many cats and they can no longer keep track of them.  They need **YOU** to solve the problem.

They need you to keep track of **2** breeds of cats.  Tortoise shells and calicos.

They want to be able to enter the count of each and know the total number of cats.  They are counting on **US** to do it!

First, let's declare a variable for each type of cat.  Then we can read from the console to set the count of each breed of cat.

{% highlight csharp %}
int tortoiseShellCats;
int calicoCats;      

Console.WriteLine("Enter number of tortoise shells:" );
tortoiseShellCats = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("Enter number of calicos:" );
calicoCats = Console.ReadLine();
{% endhighlight %}

Next we must add the count of both cats together.  This requires some simple addition which we can express below:

{% highlight csharp %}
int totalCats = tortoiseShellCats + calicoCats;
{% endhighlight %}

This will add the value of **tortoiseShellCats** to **calicoCats** and store the value in **totalCats**.

Console.WriteLine("Calicos:" );
